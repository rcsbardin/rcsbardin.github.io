<i>You are in south Texas</i>

00:00:15.182 --> 00:00:21.981
<i>and you're at the El Tule ranch 
owned by Miss Nancy B. Negley.</i>

00:00:21.981 --> 00:00:25.401
And ranch administrator, 
you're hearing him speak

00:00:25.401 --> 00:00:27.820
is Lavoyger Johnny Durham.

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:30.781
[hooves crunch dry grass]

[low rumbling]

00:00:53.763 --> 00:00:56.515
I think the flag's already 
flown off of it and stuff.

00:00:56.515 --> 00:00:59.810
I haven't checked on it in a good while.

00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:02.938
They got a windmill 
right there, real close.

00:01:02.938 --> 00:01:06.233
I just got a lot of exposure 
and a lot of publicity with it.

00:01:06.233 --> 00:01:09.779
Ya know, people in the North 
and stuff, they don't have any illegals.

00:01:09.779 --> 00:01:11.113
I mean, they have illegals all over, but--

not walking.

00:01:18.788 --> 00:01:22.458
<i>I've been interviewed 
about 10 or 15 times concerning that.</i>

00:01:22.458 --> 00:01:24.335
Wall Street Journal.

00:01:24.335 --> 00:01:29.256
A lot of Telemundos, NBC, CBS...

00:01:29.256 --> 00:01:31.550
uh, all those people.

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:35.429
I basically tell 'em what I'm telling you.

00:01:35.429 --> 00:01:36.847
<i>I had my routine.</i>

00:01:36.847 --> 00:01:38.766
<i>I meet 'em up there at the gate.</i>

00:01:38.766 --> 00:01:40.643
<i>I take 'em to my trash site.</i>

00:01:40.643 --> 00:01:42.478
<i>I take 'em to my water tank.</i>

00:01:42.478 --> 00:01:45.022
I bring 'em in there in my little museum.

00:01:45.022 --> 00:01:48.109
And then about that, 
you know, they're done.

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:50.695
So they've heard 
everything I wanted to say.

00:01:50.695 --> 00:01:51.946
I ain't got nothing else.

00:01:54.657 --> 00:01:57.201
[wind rustles leaves and branches]

00:02:02.039 --> 00:02:03.916
This is two cowboy plants.

00:02:04.834 --> 00:02:07.962
This one is called Widow's Tear.

00:02:08.713 --> 00:02:12.466
And it's got some distilled water in there

00:02:12.925 --> 00:02:15.886
See it? 
You can still see it dropping outta there.

00:02:15.886 --> 00:02:18.472
They've got some distilled water in there

00:02:18.806 --> 00:02:19.724
and, uh...

00:02:19.724 --> 00:02:22.476
cowboys, when you're riding 
in the back of the herd

00:02:22.476 --> 00:02:24.937
and you get a buncha 
god dang dirt in your eyes,

00:02:24.937 --> 00:02:26.647
you stop by and pick some of this

00:02:26.647 --> 00:02:29.275
and add it to your eye.
And it's better than Visene.

00:02:30.067 --> 00:02:31.485
Widow's Tear.

00:02:33.112 --> 00:02:35.948
<i>My AA name is LJ.</i>

<i>My Mexican cowboy name was Bocha.</i>

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:43.164
And then my real name
of course, is Lavoyger.

00:02:44.832 --> 00:02:47.668
So if you can't pronounce 
Lavoyger, that's your problem.

00:02:47.918 --> 00:02:49.337
But that's my name.

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:04.393
<i>And then I got a little obsessed

00:03:04.393 --> 00:03:07.813
everybody's waiting for me 
to put pictures on there, ya know?

00:03:07.813 --> 00:03:11.776
<i>So I just had to do it 
and I do two every night.</i>

00:03:12.193 --> 00:03:15.196 position:10% align:left
That's my father

of Life Magazine.

00:03:18.157 --> 00:03:19.700
I'm very proud of that picture.

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:24.997
<i>I was born and raised on the Norias 
division of the King Ranch.</i>

<i>And then I left there in 1989.</i>

00:03:28.751 --> 00:03:34.215

and plugged, with Ms. Negley.

00:03:42.682 --> 00:03:44.767
One of the last times he was ever here.

00:03:45.142 --> 00:03:47.728
That's Lady Bird. 
She came down there a couple of times.

00:03:47.728 --> 00:03:48.938
Lady Bird Johnson.

00:03:50.523 --> 00:03:53.818
He's one of the dead people that we found.

00:03:53.859 --> 00:03:59.615
This guy, he had a perfect 
golden star on his tooth.

[Holbrook] They're running?

Well, do we want to use the

And he told me when I 
got through opening the gate and

00:06:46.782 --> 00:06:49.785
I jumped back in the car, 
that he wanted for me to...

00:06:50.286 --> 00:06:53.956
to start to doing two things.
One is to start wearing shoes

00:06:53.956 --> 00:06:56.625
and the other one is 
to start speaking English to him.

Mexican and they'd come around and

call me pepper belly and spic and all that shit.

It didn't make any difference how big the guy was.

00:08:25.131 --> 00:08:27.008
I'd get in a fight with him.

because I didn't feel like 
they were making fun of me...

00:08:31.554 --> 00:08:33.931
They were actually making fun of my mother.

00:08:35.349 --> 00:08:36.767
And that really hurt me...

00:08:37.435 --> 00:08:38.853

00:09:04.295 --> 00:09:06.547 align:left line:10%
They'll be all over the ranch.

00:09:06.547 --> 00:09:07.882
[twigs crunching]

00:09:07.882 --> 00:09:09.467 align:right line:10%
[bottles thud against metal]

00:09:08.799 --> 00:09:11.052
They wait for the pickup 
which is right there on 285.

00:09:11.385 --> 00:09:13.721 align:right
[Holbrook] Man...
[exhales]

00:09:13.721 --> 00:09:15.973 align:right
being a coyote would not be fun.

00:09:15.973 --> 00:09:16.974 align:right
[exhaling] whew...

00:09:16.974 --> 00:09:18.476 align:left line:50%
[Lavoyger] You will, if you get paid.

00:09:18.476 --> 00:09:18.976 align:left line:50%
Holbrook!

00:09:19.143 --> 00:09:20.227 align:right
Yes?! What do you need?

00:09:20.394 --> 00:09:22.521 align:left line:50%
[Lavoyger] Coyote gets paid about $4,000.

00:09:23.022 --> 00:09:25.775 align:right
I know, but the coyote also 
probably has blood on their hands

00:09:25.775 --> 00:09:28.361 align:right
because when someone 
twists an ankle, they keep going.

00:09:28.652 --> 00:09:29.862 align:left line:10%
They'll kill 'em right there.

00:09:29.570 --> 00:09:31.280 align:left
That doesn't make any difference to them.

00:09:30.571 --> 00:09:31.906 align:right line:10%
They will?

00:09:32.656 --> 00:09:35.284 align:left
The more people they get up there, 
the more they get paid.

00:09:34.450 --> 00:09:36.285 line:10%
They leave them behind.

00:09:35.242 --> 00:09:38.662 align:right line:10%
They have children that 
come through here!

00:09:35.284 --> 00:09:37.328 align:left
So they gotta take care of 'em.

00:09:38.662 --> 00:09:40.122 align:left
[Ryan] It's not like the Navy seals.

00:09:40.122 --> 00:09:42.375 align:right
[Jonathan] No, they'll do 
whatever they gotta do.

00:09:42.375 --> 00:09:44.001
[Holbrook] No, it's terrible.

00:09:45.002 --> 00:09:47.713 align:right
[Kate] Lavoyger, have you caught any live...

00:09:45.628 --> 00:09:47.755 align:left line:10%
[Jonathan] Each of them get paid two, three grand.

00:09:47.755 --> 00:09:49.090 align:left
[Lavoyger] What Kate?

00:09:49.090 --> 00:09:51.258 align:right
Have you caught any live...
people?

00:09:51.258 --> 00:09:52.343 align:left
Any live?

00:09:52.343 --> 00:09:53.344 align:left line:10%
[Ryan snickering] live?

00:09:53.344 --> 00:09:54.345 align:right
Well no! I mean...

00:09:54.303 --> 00:09:56.013
[Hillary] Any a-live.

00:09:57.431 --> 00:09:58.933 align:right
live...humans.

00:09:58.099 --> 00:10:01.018 line:10%
[Jonathan] Like the border patrol catch em?
Is that what you're saying?

00:10:00.309 --> 00:10:03.270 align:right
[Kate] Well, I know how he finds...
he'll interview them when he...

00:10:04.271 --> 00:10:05.314 align:right
when they come to his...

00:10:05.481 --> 00:10:08.526 align:right
And have you brought them to your house 
and interviewed any lately?

00:10:08.526 --> 00:10:09.902 line:10%
Yes. They've gone to his house.

00:10:09.902 --> 00:10:13.531
Not lately, but I love to interview 'em

00:10:14.198 --> 00:10:17.243
They come to my house for two reasons.

00:10:17.284 --> 00:10:18.953
One, they get raided.

00:10:19.620 --> 00:10:21.247 align:left line:10%
Two, you're a nice guy.

00:10:19.829 --> 00:10:21.789
some of 'em get lost. 
Okay?

00:10:22.581 --> 00:10:25.167
They don't know nothing about where 
they're supposed to go.

00:10:25.167 --> 00:10:26.544 align:left line:10%
And you got, got satellite TV.

00:10:26.002 --> 00:10:27.128
Two...Two

00:10:27.128 --> 00:10:29.714
Did you ask the question or did he?

00:10:29.714 --> 00:10:31.090 align:left line:10%
[laughter]

00:10:31.048 --> 00:10:32.633 align:right line:10%
I asked the question.
That's why I'm listening.

00:10:32.633 --> 00:10:33.926
Thank you very much, Holbrook.

00:10:33.926 --> 00:10:35.386
Just hold back here a little bit.

00:10:35.386 --> 00:10:36.929
You'll have your time here in a minute.

00:10:36.929 --> 00:10:39.890
The other reason that they 
come back is when they get left

00:10:39.890 --> 00:10:42.852
and they get left because they 
can't keep up with the coyote.

00:10:40.891 --> 00:10:41.892 align:right line:10%
That's terrible.

00:10:42.852 --> 00:10:43.853 align:right line:10%
Right

00:10:43.227 --> 00:10:44.645
Then they're lost.

00:10:45.271 --> 00:10:46.897
And they come up there my house..

00:10:46.897 --> 00:10:49.734
and I asked them, "How many are you?"

00:10:49.734 --> 00:10:51.152
And they said, "Well, it's me."

00:10:51.152 --> 00:10:53.279
I said, "Sweetheart, you look very tired.

00:10:53.279 --> 00:10:55.531
Don't you want to go back home?"
and she says, "Yes."

00:10:55.531 --> 00:10:57.324
And I said, "I'll tell you what I'm gonna do."

00:10:57.324 --> 00:10:58.909
Said, "I'm gonna give you some water and

00:10:58.909 --> 00:11:00.411
I'm gonna give you something to eat."

00:11:00.411 --> 00:11:03.706
"And then I'm gonna tell 
my camera man to come over here."

00:11:03.706 --> 00:11:05.207
"And do you mind if we interview you?"

00:11:05.207 --> 00:11:06.208 align:right line:50%
Yeah.

00:11:06.208 --> 00:11:07.209
And they said, "No."

00:11:07.209 --> 00:11:08.502
So they'll sit there and eat and

00:11:08.502 --> 00:11:11.630
I'm sitting over there and Isaac has 
got my little camera corder and I'm

00:11:11.630 --> 00:11:14.467
asking them in English and in Spanish.

00:11:14.467 --> 00:11:19.555
So the gringo can get me on YouTube 
and can understand. Like him, see?

00:11:19.555 --> 00:11:21.557
and I'm always fascinated...

00:11:22.308 --> 00:11:27.229
by how a woman from Salvador 
or Guatemala or Honduras...

00:11:26.103 --> 00:11:27.605 align:left line:50%
Makes it all the way up here on her own?

00:11:27.605 --> 00:11:29.148
make it all the way up here.

00:11:29.148 --> 00:11:30.608 align:right line:50%
And then you send them back.

00:11:30.608 --> 00:11:31.734
Well, she wants to.

00:11:31.734 --> 00:11:32.651 align:right line:50%
She does?

00:11:32.651 --> 00:11:33.652
Yes.

00:11:33.652 --> 00:11:36.906
The ones that said, "Noooo, I can't.
I don't want to go back."

00:11:36.906 --> 00:11:39.700
And I said, "Well...[hits truck] 
Get in that Excursion.

00:11:39.700 --> 00:11:41.994
I wanna give you some water.
I wanna give you some food.

00:11:42.328 --> 00:11:43.454
Get in that Excursion.

00:11:43.454 --> 00:11:44.914
I wanna take you to the highway.

00:11:45.331 --> 00:11:47.750
Ya hit this pipeline, 
it'll take you to Falfurrias.

00:11:47.750 --> 00:11:48.751
You can hide there.

00:11:48.751 --> 00:11:49.752
Okay?

00:11:49.752 --> 00:11:50.878
And if you get tired...

00:11:50.878 --> 00:11:53.756
you just get on the highway 
and somebody will pick you up [slaps truck]

00:11:53.756 --> 00:11:54.924
Usually a border patrol.

00:11:55.633 --> 00:11:58.302
[Holbrook] That is...
that is not a fun trek for those people.

00:11:58.302 --> 00:11:59.804 align:left line:50%
[Lavoyger laughing]

00:11:58.552 --> 00:11:59.720
Uhfff.

00:11:59.804 --> 00:12:00.805 align:right line:50%
[Kate] No, I mean...

00:12:00.346 --> 00:12:01.389
[Holbrook] No, gracias.

00:12:01.639 --> 00:12:02.640 align:left line:50%
[Lavoyger sighs]

00:12:02.640 --> 00:12:03.641
No, thank you.

00:12:03.557 --> 00:12:06.394 align:right line:50%
[Kate]I wonder how far they've come to this point.

00:12:08.979 --> 00:12:11.482
[windmill clanking]

00:12:13.776 --> 00:12:15.361 align:right
[Woman speaks in Spanish]
Por diner..

00:12:15.528 --> 00:12:17.988 align:right
[in Spanish TBD]

00:12:18.155 --> 00:12:19.407 align:right
Por gusto.
[sniffles]

00:12:19.573 --> 00:12:20.574 align:left
Por gusto.

00:12:20.574 --> 00:12:21.367 align:left
They say that uh...

00:12:21.367 --> 00:12:27.707 align:left
I was asking her, "Why did they 
kill your parents and husband

00:12:27.707 --> 00:12:31.293 align:left
and everything and said, 
"Well, lots of times they, did do it for fun.

00:12:31.460 --> 00:12:34.714 align:left
And sometimes they do it for a...

00:12:34.714 --> 00:12:36.382 align:left
demanding...money.

00:12:36.382 --> 00:12:38.759 align:left
That they want money down there."

00:12:38.759 --> 00:12:39.760 align:left
Los...

00:12:40.177 --> 00:12:42.263 align:left
si...sicarios?
Sicarios.

00:12:42.430 --> 00:12:43.431 align:left
The murderers.

[crying, sniffles]

00:12:44.557 --> 00:12:46.308 align:left
Y quantos hijos tienes a ya?
How many kids.

00:12:45.474 --> 00:12:46.642 line:50%
Tres.

00:12:47.059 --> 00:12:50.521 align:left
She's got got three sons left over there.

00:12:51.772 --> 00:12:54.442 align:left
She oughta explain it to the immigration officer

00:12:55.317 --> 00:12:58.779 align:left
or officers, that the reason 
that she left over there was

00:12:58.779 --> 00:13:01.073 align:left
because she wanted
 to get away and ah...

00:13:01.073 --> 00:13:04.535 align:left
probably send some 
money back to her sons to...

00:13:04.952 --> 00:13:07.621 align:left
support 'em. And 
if she goes back, she's afraid they'll kill her.

00:13:07.955 --> 00:13:09.957 align:left
Like they did her husband and her parents and...

00:13:10.499 --> 00:13:12.084 align:left
a lot of her family.

00:13:12.460 --> 00:13:15.046
Well, since my mother was Mexican...

00:13:16.756 --> 00:13:19.342
and my father was kinda gringo...

00:13:19.967 --> 00:13:21.469
[laughing] I always say that I can...

00:13:23.596 --> 00:13:25.681
jump the fence either way.

00:13:26.265 --> 00:13:28.809
wherever I'm needed the least.

00:13:28.934 --> 00:13:30.853
[raspy laughter]

00:13:31.479 --> 00:13:32.772
I've got compassion...I,

00:13:32.772 --> 00:13:34.231
ya know, I...I...

00:13:34.231 --> 00:13:38.903
Like some of these people
 that I interview or give a ride to...

00:13:42.823 --> 00:13:45.576
it's all according to the way I feel.

00:13:47.828 --> 00:13:49.663
And I tell the border patrol that.

00:13:50.247 --> 00:13:54.335
I'm not aiding and abetting people 
because I give them a ride up there

00:13:54.335 --> 00:13:56.212
to the to the main highway

00:13:56.212 --> 00:13:57.463
and stuff.

00:13:57.963 --> 00:13:59.382
And if I feel like it...

00:14:00.508 --> 00:14:01.759
I turn 'em in.

00:14:03.010 --> 00:14:04.887
And if I don't feel like it...

00:14:04.887 --> 00:14:06.514
I leave 'em alone.

00:14:07.515 --> 00:14:09.642
<i>Most of the time I leave 'em alone.</i>

00:14:10.935 --> 00:14:11.936
Over here, over here.

00:14:12.812 --> 00:14:13.562 align:left
[Lavoyger] Go around Ryan.

00:14:15.356 --> 00:14:17.149
So squeeze through there then

00:14:19.777 --> 00:14:21.487 align:left
[Lavoyger] Oooohhh Lord.

00:14:23.614 --> 00:14:24.949
Just so we can cover some ground--

00:14:24.949 --> 00:14:26.951
Y'all! 
Watch out for snakes, dammit.

00:14:29.495 --> 00:14:30.496
I see 'em.

00:14:30.496 --> 00:14:31.747
They're over there in the back.

00:14:31.956 --> 00:14:32.957 align:right line:50%
[Holbrook] I got 'em.

00:14:32.581 --> 00:14:33.249
